#####This is a blog post. Watches are below.

###Maratac Pilot Mid

This is my _Maratac_ _Pilot_ _Mid_ **Watch**. It's one of my favorites, as evidenced by my use of HTML formatting when I mention it.

###Rolex Submariner 
This is a Rolex Submariner 14060M. You probably see this image to the left of the text because that's where I've tried to align it, but if your viewport is smaller, it might be above what you're reading now.

###Tudor Heritage Black Bay Black
To my right (or above if you're viewing from a small viewport) is a Tudor Heritage Black Bay Black on my wife's wrist. I used the "r-img" class to accomplish this. Like the left-aligned image, if the viewport is small, the image shifts to be full-width.



I'm going to go ahead and let you know that there will be a lot of watches discussed here. There will also be posts about other things, like running, cycling, and sometimes golf. If you don't like a subject that I've posted about, you don't have to read it. That's fine.

To recap, you might see posts about

- Golf
- Running
- Cycling
- Watches

In order of how much I expect to post about each topic, from most to least:

1. Watches
2. Running/Cycling
3. Golf

We'll make sure things stay interesting, like this NATO strap I wore one time.

I might even post a picture of the first "nice" watch I ever had.
###Citizen EcoDrive Perpetual Calendar Chronograph
